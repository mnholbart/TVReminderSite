# TVReminderSite

The TVTracker is a small website that currently allows login and out as well as searching for and favoriting TV shows by making use of the TVMaze API.

After making a list of your favorite shows you can view your watchlist which will organize shows and tell you new information about your shows, such as new seasons starting or when the next episode will be airing.
